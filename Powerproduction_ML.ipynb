    "### Wind Power\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind power (or wind energy) is a general term describing energy generated from wind, where the wind kinetic enrgy is converted into electrical power. Typically, the power is generated in wind turbins.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is many factors influencing the generated output, but wind speed is a fundamental contributor. Wikipedia article states that the power is proportional to the third power of the wind speed ([Wind power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\frac{1}{2} A \\rho v^3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P$ is the power output, $A$ corresponds to the size of the turbin, $\\rho$ is the air density and $v$ is the wind speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practical terms, the observed power output follows a more complex pattern ([Wind education - Wind power](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power)).\n",
    "\n",
    "![https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/thumb/1/19/Windpowercurve.png/400px-Windpowercurve.png](https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/thumb/1/19/Windpowercurve.png/400px-Windpowercurve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The wind turbin activates on a certain treshold wind speed - cut-in speed. Below that speed the turbin operation is not economically viable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum power output is achieved at the rated wind speed - turbin specific. In the zone between the cut-in and rated speeds, the power increases exponencially with the wind speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the rated speed, the produced output remains approximately flat (or may decline gently), until it reaches the cut-off speed. At such speed, the turbine is shut down in order to prevent them from taking damege. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that the above power curve is only a crude approximation of the observed amount of energy produced in reality. "

The units of the values are not explicitly given. Possibly the wind speed is shown in m/s, whereas power values represents the turbin efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wind speed values varies from 0 to 25 and are shown in ascending order. Every speed value is unique. The power output values varies from 0 to 113.556. There are 49 instances (approximatelly 10% of all observations) where the power output equals zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "Such a behaviour agrees closely with the wind power curve shown above ([Wind education - Wind power](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power)). It can be explained by the fact that at low wind speed - in zone A - the wind does not carry sufficient energy to turn the turbines or it is not economically justified. The genreated power output readings are not affected by the wind speed in this region. These readings may be caused by other factors (noise). For this analyis, however, it is assumed these are valid output readings.  \n",
    "In zone B there is a nearly linear (even close to exponencial) correlation between the wind speed and the power output.  \n",
    "When wind speed exceeds approximately 17, the wind turbines work with a high performance, close to its 100% efficiency. However, the power output declines slightl with incrasing wind speed, up to approximately 24.5 - zone C.  \n",
    "In the zone D where the winds are very strong, the power output is not produced. The power generation abruptly ceases, possibly because the turbines are shut off for safety reasons."
