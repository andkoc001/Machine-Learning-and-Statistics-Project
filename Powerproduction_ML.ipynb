The power output predictions should be generated in response to wind speed values to be obtained as HTTP requests.\n",

    "## Wind Power\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind power (or wind energy) is a general term describing energy generated from wind, where the wind kinetic enrgy is converted into electrical power. Typically, the power is generated in wind turbins.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is many factors influencing the generated output, but wind speed is a fundamental contributor. Wikipedia article states that the power is proportional to the third power of the wind speed ([Wind power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\frac{1}{2} A \\rho v^3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P$ is the power output, $A$ corresponds to the size of the turbin, $\\rho$ is the air density and $v$ is the wind speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practical terms, the observed power output follows a more complex pattern ([Wind education - Wind power](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power)).\n",
    "\n",
    "![https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/thumb/1/19/Windpowercurve.png/400px-Windpowercurve.png](https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/thumb/1/19/Windpowercurve.png/400px-Windpowercurve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The wind turbin activates on a certain treshold wind speed - cut-in speed. Below that speed the turbin operation is not economically viable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum power output is achieved at the rated wind speed - turbin specific. In the zone between the cut-in and rated speeds, the power increases exponencially with the wind speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the rated speed, the produced output remains approximately flat (or may decline gently), until it reaches the cut-off speed. At such speed, the turbine is shut down in order to prevent them from taking damege. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that the above power curve is only a crude approximation of the observed amount of energy produced in reality. "

    "### Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above dataset description and data points plot, the following conclusions can be drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set consist of 500 observations (rows). Each observation consists of 2 attributes (columns): wind speed (`speed`) and corresponding power output (`power`). The units of the values are not explicitly given.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wind speed values varies from 0 to 25 and are shown in ascending order. Every speed value is unique. The power output values varies from 0 to 113.556. There are 49 instances (approximatelly 10% of all observations) where the power output equals zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the plot one can observe three distinct areas with different behaviour of the data points. I will refer to them as zones A, B, C and D.\n",
    "\n",
    "A - The wind speed ranging from 0 to about 8, genreates virtually no power output. \n",
    "B - In wind speed range from about 9 to about 17, there is a strong  seamingly exponentinal correlation between the wind speed and the power output.\n",
    "C - When wind speed exceeds approximately 17, the wind turbines work with a high performance. However, the power output declines slightl with incrasing wind speed, up to approximately 24.\n",
    "D - Above wind speed level of approximately 24, the power output abruptly ceases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a behavior agrees closely with the plot shown above ([Wind education - Wind power](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power)). It can be explained by the fact that at low wind speed (zone A) the wind does not carry sufficient energy to turn the turbines or it is not economically justified and so do not generate any power. On the other hand, in the zone D where the winds are very strong, the power output is not produced, possibly because the turbines are shut off for safety reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally, there is a number of observations where the power output is zero, even though the wind speeds are in zones allowing for producing the power. In total, there is 49 observations with power output equal to zero. It is assumed these data points represent observations during, for example, maintenance works, when the turbin was shut down."
