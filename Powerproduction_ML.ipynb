    "## Wind Power\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind power (or wind energy) is a general term describing energy generated from wind, where the wind kinetic enrgy is converted into electrical power. Typically, the power is generated in wind turbins.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is many factors influencing the generated output, but wind speed is a fundamental contributor. Wikipedia article states that the power is proportional to the third power of the wind speed ([Wind power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\frac{1}{2} A \\rho v^3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P$ is the power output, $A$ corresponds to the size of the turbin, $\\rho$ is the air density and $v$ is the wind speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practical terms, the observed power output follows a more complex pattern ([Wind education - Wind power](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power)).\n",
    "\n",
    "![https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/thumb/1/19/Windpowercurve.png/400px-Windpowercurve.png](https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/thumb/1/19/Windpowercurve.png/400px-Windpowercurve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The wind turbin activates on a certain treshold wind speed - cut-in speed. Below that speed the turbin operation is not economically viable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum power output is achieved at the rated wind speed - turbin specific. In the zone between the cut-in and rated speeds, the power increases exponencially with the wind speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the rated speed, the produced output remains approximately flat (or may decline gently), until it reaches the cut-off speed. At such speed, the turbine is shut down in order to prevent them from taking damege. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that the above power curve is only a crude approximation of the observed amount of energy produced in reality. "

    "### First thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above dataset description and data points plot, the following conclusions can be drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set consist of 500 observations (rows). Each observation consists of 2 attributes (columns): wind speed (`speed`) and corresponding power output (`power`). The units of the values are not explicitly given.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wind speed values varies from 0 to 25 and are shown in descending order. The power output values varies from 0 to 113.556. There are 49 instances where the power output equals zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the plot one can observe three distinct areas with different behaviour of the data points. I will refer to them as zones a), b), c) and d).\n",
    "\n",
    "a) With wind speed from 0 to about 8, the power output is near to none. \n",
    "b) There is a strong almost linear correlation the wind speed and the power output in wind speed range from about 9 to about 17.\n",
    "c) When wind speed exceeds approximately 17, its effect on the power output is close to constant, and the wind turbines work with a high performance.\n",
    "d) Above certain wind speed level, approximately 24, the power output abruptly ceased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a behavior can be, perhaps, explained by the fact that at low wind speed (zone a))the wind turbines do not generate any power (or it is not economically justified). On the other hand, in the zone d) where the winds are very strong, the power output is not produced, as if the turbines are shut off for safety reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally, there is a number of observations where the power output is zero, even though the wind speeds are in zones allowing for producing the power. These are assumed to be data anomaly (e.g. due to incorrect reading). In total, there is 49 observations with power output equal to zero. "
