## Introduction

This repository documents my research, progress and findings on the assgiment project for Machine Learning and Statistics module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2020. Lecturer: dr Ian McLoughlin

### Assignment delivery

This project avail of several tools commonly used in the industry, such as Python programing language, Jupyter Notebook, Dokker, Git, etc.

The project is delivered via this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/andkoc001/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics.git).

In the notebooks I have incorporated the research and described the project progress. It is illustrated the applied concepts and methods together with relevant code snippets. The notebook includes also the calculated outputs and plots with accompanied description. Finally, inside the notebook I have included also references to sources being consulted for this assignment.

The project is done in a Jupyter Notebook [Powerproduction_ML.ipynb](https://github.com/andkoc001/data_synthesis/blob/master/Powerproduction_ML.ipynb).

### Viewing the Notebook

For viewing the notebook online, it is recommended to use Jupyter Notebooks viewer, [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Paste the link to the notebook to be inspected into provided field.

## Project objectives

### Instruction

The objective of the is to develop a web service to make predictions using Machine Learning (ML) paradigm.

The goal of the project is to produce a model or models that, based on the provided dataset powerproduction, and through applying the appropriate ML techniques, predicts power output generated by wind turbine from wind. The power output predictions should be generated in response to wind speed values to be obtained as HTTP requests.
