## Introduction

This repository houses my assgiment project for Machine Learning and Statistics module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2020.

### Project objectives

The objective of the is to develop a web service to make predictions using Machine Learning (ML) paradigm.

The goal of the project is to produce a model or models that, based on the provided dataset powerproduction, and through applying the appropriate ML techniques, predicts power output generated by wind turbine from wind. The power output predictions should be generated in response to wind speed values to be obtained as HTTP requests.

The detailed project instruction can be found in the pdf [file](https://github.com/andkoc001/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project/blob/main/assessment.pdf).

### Assignment delivery

This project avails of several platforms commonly used in the industry, such as Jupyter Notebook, Web Server, Docker, etc.

In the Jupyter Notebook [Powerproduction_ML.ipynb](https://github.com/andkoc001/data_synthesis/blob/master/Powerproduction_ML.ipynb) in this repository, I have incorporated the research and described the project progress. It is illustrated the machine learning concepts and applied methods together with relevant code snippets. The notebook includes also the calculated outputs and plots with accompanied description.

A web app is build upon the Flask framework. The local server hosts the selected machine learnign models used in the project. An attractive front-end web page has been designed to present the results in user-friendly way.

The web app is also available in a virtualised container on Docker platform.

### Accessing the Project

#### Viewing Notebook

For viewing the notebook online, it is recommended to use Jupyter Notebooks viewer, [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Paste the link to the notebook to be inspected into provided field.

#### Accessing the Web App

In order to open the web app, inside the directory containing the repository (download it from this github repository, keeping the directory structure intact) and execute the following commands in the terminal.

A) Linux

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
python3 -m flask run
```

B) Windows

```bash
set FLASK_APP=app.py
python -m flask run
```

C) Docker

```bash
docker build . -t wind-power-app
docker run -i -t -p 5000:5000 --rm wind-power-app 
```
